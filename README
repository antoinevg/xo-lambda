= About =

XO-Lambda is a simple Lisp interpreter for the OLPC XO-1 featuring:

* Integer & Real numeric types
* Mark & Sweep garbage collection
* A simple foreign function interface
* A full screen editor which can freely mix text and graphics
* Implemented in ~2000 lines of (mostly) C
* Released under a MIT/X11 license

The goal of xo-lambda is not to be a full featured, standards
compliant, high performance Lisp as there already exists several
excellent examples of such systems!

Rather, the xo-lambda system attempts to accomplish two highly
specialized objectives:


1. Fun - A text based Lisp console may be a barrel-load of fun if all
         you have is a 300 baud modem and an account on a university
         mainframe but if you have a bitmapped color display, a video
         camera, microphone and 16 bit digital audio you have to ask
         yourself: "Can this thing sing?"

2. Simplicity - There is an enormous difference in complexity between
                the original single page implementation of Lisp in
                John McCarthy's 1960 paper and modern
                implementations. Given the performance improvements
                computers have seen in the last few years it seems
                that there is significant educational value to be
                gotten from a system which, while performant enough to
                have fun, is still simple enough that it can reveal
                all of its secrets to the dedicated student in a
                reasonable amount of time.
